# Solana Facts

Welcome to Solana Facts, an open source project dedicated to collecting and sharing interesting facts about Solana

The CODEOWNERS of this repo act as benevelont dictators. We'll do our best to verify what you submit is factual based on the information at hand. This project is intentionally simple. Right now it's maintained in our spare time so please keep this in mind.
